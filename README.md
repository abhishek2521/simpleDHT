In this project, I have implemented a  simple DHT based on Chord.It implements 3 important features
1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning,
2) Ring-based routing, and 
3) Node joins.

The project supports insertion , deletion and querying of key,value pairs . The key,value are stored in the content provider .Wild card Queries like * and @ are also su[pported
